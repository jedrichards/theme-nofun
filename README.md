[Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Motivation

To each their own, but I find that syntax highlighting that lights up code like a Christmas tree hinders my ability to parse the semantics. You spend more time tripping over the changing colours than naturally reading the prose. Undistracted the conscious mind brings the structure and meaning of the code to the foreground. Context switching between languages becomes less disorientating.

Everything in moderation however, so while abstaining from colourising the bulk of the syntax we retain some gentle highlighting for picking out comments and string and number constants. Selections, highlights and find results are also conspicuously picked out.
